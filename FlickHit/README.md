🎶 FlickHit: Cultural Playback App  
“Match the date of your Flick to its #1 Hit”

💡 Problem Statement  
In the age of digital overload, our photos often become lifeless thumbnails—stripped of the sound, feeling, and cultural atmosphere that surrounded them. People flip through old pictures, but rarely do they reconnect emotionally with the full context of the moment. There’s no soundtrack. No era. Just pixels.

💡 Solution  
FlickHit is a web app that brings still images back to life. Users upload a photo, and FlickHit reads the original date from its metadata. Then, it instantly links you to the #1 Billboard Hot 100 song from that specific week, reconnecting you to the music and mood of that time.

It’s like time-travel through memory. You don’t just look at a picture—you hear it.

🔊 What is “FlickHit”?  
It’s not just an app—it’s a verb or a powerful statement.  
When you see a picture and want to unlock its musical memory, you can simply say: FlickHit (pronounced like "flick it" or "flick hit"). It's both the action of revealing the #1 song from that moment, and the immediate, memorable declaration of wanting to experience that connection.

“We saw that picture of us at our wedding and immediately, we just said: 'FlickHit!'”  
“Scrolling through old photos, I hit my graduation pictures and knew I had to FlickHit them.”  
“That moment when you find a forgotten memory and all you can think is, 'FlickHit!'”

FlickHit turns scrolling into storytelling.
