Killing Time Games: Mindless Games to Kill Time
About This Project
Killing Time Games is a simple browser-based app designed to help you pass the time—without pulling you out of the moment. Whether you’re waiting to be called into a job interview or sitting in a hospital lobby, this is your guilt-free way to stay occupied without blasting zombies or doomscrolling.

It includes three quick, familiar games—Rock Paper Scissors, Odds and Evens, and Coin Flip—with a twist: you can play the classic versions, choose from humorous themed matchups like "The Rock vs. Toilet Paper," or even create your own characters and rules.

This isn’t about high scores or boss battles—it’s a pocket-sized distraction with personality, built for real-life waiting rooms, not war zones.

Features
This application includes three classic games, each with unique customization options:

Rock Paper Scissors:

Classic Mode: Play the traditional game against the computer.

How It Works
Single-Page Application: All games are contained within a single index.html file, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

Client-Side Logic: All game logic and state management are handled directly in the browser using JavaScript.

Local Storage Persistence: Custom game names and scores are automatically saved in your browser's local storage, so your preferences and progress are remembered between sessions.

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS, the interface is designed to adapt gracefully to various screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.

Project Development
AI helped shape the entire build—from structuring the code to solving logic bugs. It even helped translate ideas into working JavaScript, speeding up development and keeping things fun and frustration-free.

This project was developed as part of an AI Native Journey, focusing on creating interactive, client-side web applications. It showcases the use of HTML, CSS (with Tailwind), and JavaScript to build engaging user experiences with persistent local data storage.
