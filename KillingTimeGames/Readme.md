## 🧠 About This Project

**Killing Time Games** is a lightweight browser-based app designed to help users pass the time—*without losing focus or falling down a digital rabbit hole*. Whether you're waiting for your name to be called at a job interview or sitting in a hospital lobby, this is your guilt-free way to stay occupied. No zombies, no explosions—just quick, silly fun with a personal touch.

The app includes **three familiar games**—Rock Paper Scissors, Coin Flip, and Odds & Evens—each with unique game modes. You can play the classic versions, enjoy themed “Fun” matchups (like *The Rock vs. Toilet Paper*), or invent your own characters and rules.

This isn’t about leveling up or beating a final boss—it’s a pocket-sized distraction built for real-world lulls, not digital war zones.

## 🤖 Built with AI Assistance

AI played an integral role in this project—from writing the initial code structure to solving logic bugs and generating creative game mode ideas. It helped me build faster, iterate smarter, and stay focused on crafting something delightful.

This app was developed as part of my **AI Native Journey**, with an emphasis on building real-time, interactive front-end experiences using:

- **HTML**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
- **Local Storage APIs**
