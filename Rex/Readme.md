Rex: Your Personal Media Vault (Automation Tool)
About This Project
In a world overflowing with content, it's often hard to keep up. We get so many amazing recommendations from friends, family, and online sources ‚Äì for movies, TV shows, music, books, and podcasts ‚Äì that we inevitably end up forgetting about a lot of the things that sounded interesting to us at one point. There are countless titles we genuinely wanted to see or listen to, but they just slipped our minds. And then, there's that weird paradox: even with all this content out there, you're sitting at home feeling like you have nothing to watch, nothing to listen to, nothing to read.

That's where Rex comes in, spelled R-E-X, playing on words for "recommendations."

Rex is a lightweight, clean, and personal automation tool designed to solve this problem. It's your private vault for cultural gems, making it effortless to quickly log, organize, and manage media recommendations from people who matter to you, ensuring you never forget a great suggestion again. This application was developed with a strong focus on automation, streamlining the process of data entry, organization, and retrieval.

Features
Quick & Detailed Logging: Easily add new recommendations. Each entry includes:

Title: The name of the movie, book, song, etc.

Type: Categorize your media (Movie üìΩÔ∏è, TV Show üì∫, Music üéµ, Book üìö, Podcast üéôÔ∏è).

Recommended by: Track who suggested the gem to you.

(Note: The current version does not include a separate "brief description" field for each entry, but this could be a future enhancement!)

Automated Data Persistence: All your recommendations are automatically saved directly in your browser's local storage, meaning your data is safe and persists even after closing the app or browser. No manual saving needed!

Intelligent Filtering:

Filter by Type: Instantly narrow down your list to see only Movies, Podcasts, Books, etc., with a simple dropdown selection.

Filter by Recommender: Type a name, and the list will automatically filter to show only recommendations from that specific person. This supports partial and case-insensitive matching for quick searching.

Flexible Sorting: Organize your vault exactly how you need it:

By Date Added (Newest or Oldest First)

By Title (Alphabetical A-Z or Z-A)

By Recommender Name (Alphabetical A-Z or Z-A)

Clean & Minimal Interface: A user-friendly design that focuses on functionality, making the logging and retrieval process intuitive and efficient.

How It Works (Automation Focus)
Rex acts as an automation tool by significantly reducing the manual effort typically involved in managing recommendations:

Streamlined Entry: The app automates the input process by clearing fields and returning focus after each entry, allowing for rapid, continuous logging.

Effortless Organization: It automatically categorizes and stores your entries based on the type and recommender you provide, eliminating the need for manual sorting or creating separate lists.

Instant Retrieval: The powerful filtering and sorting options automate the discovery process. Instead of manually scanning lists, you can instantly pull up recommendations by a specific person or media type, or sort them to find what you need without any manual rearrangement.

Automatic Saving: Data persistence is fully automated using browser Local Storage. Your "vault" is always up-to-date without you ever needing to click a "save" button.

This project showcases how simple, client-side web applications can leverage browser features to provide powerful, personal automation.

How to Access and Use Rex
To use the Rex app:

Access the Live App: Open your web browser and go to the live GitHub Pages link:
https://willco8.github.io/rex-app/

Add Recommendations (The Logging Process):

On Rex, you'll see a section to "Add New Recommendation."

Type in the Title of the movie, album, song, podcast, or book.

Click the "Type" dropdown box and select the appropriate category (e.g., Movie, Podcast).

Then, in the "Recommended by" box, type in who recommended it to you.

Once you fill out this bit of information and click "Add Recommendation" (or press Enter), it automatically saves to the app and appears in your list below!

Explore & Organize:

Use the "Filter by Type" dropdown to see specific media categories.

Type a name into the "Filter by Recommender" box to find recommendations from that person.

Use the "Sort by" dropdown to arrange your list by date, title, or recommender.

Delete Recommendations: Click the "Delete" button next to any item to remove it from your vault.

Your data is automatically saved in your browser's local storage, so it will be there the next time you visit the app.

Project Development
Rex was developed as part of an AI Native Journey, demonstrating the power of iterative development and AI-assisted coding. The project emphasizes client-side web technologies (HTML, CSS with Tailwind, JavaScript) for a lightweight, self-contained solution.

Note on Project Evolution:
This project represents a pivot from an earlier concept, "Stream of Thought." While "Stream of Thought" focused on general note-taking automation, "Rex" was chosen as the final project because it addresses a more specific and relatable problem (managing media recommendations) in a fun and engaging way, making it more appealing for demonstration and practical use. This decision allowed for a deeper focus on relevant automation features within a defined scope.
