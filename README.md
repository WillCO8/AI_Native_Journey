## 🎯 Elevator Pitch: Killing Time Games

**“Killing Time Games”** is a simple browser-based app designed to help you pass the time—without pulling you out of the moment. Whether you’re waiting to be called into a job interview or sitting in a hospital lobby, this is your guilt-free way to stay occupied without blasting zombies or doomscrolling.

It includes three quick, familiar games—Rock Paper Scissors, Odds and Evens, and Coin Flip—with a twist: you can play the classic versions, choose from humorous themed matchups like *The Rock vs. Toilet Paper*, or even create your own characters and rules.

AI helped shape the entire build—from structuring the code to solving logic bugs. It even helped translate ideas into working JavaScript, speeding up development and keeping things fun and frustration-free.

This isn’t about high scores or boss battles—it’s a pocket-sized distraction with personality, built for real-life waiting rooms, not war zones.

## 🛠️ How It Started vs. How It’s Going

This project began as a simple Rock Paper Scissors game written in Python as part of a class assignment. But as I explored what I could build with the help of AI, the scope expanded into something more playful and polished. What started as a basic script evolved into **Killing Time Games** — a browser-based app with themed versions, creative customizations, and a clean interface, all designed to offer casual fun without pulling users too far out of real-life moments.
