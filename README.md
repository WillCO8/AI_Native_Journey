Picture Puzzle Project Plan
Here's the documentation for my selected project, the interactive picture puzzle tool:

Project Pitch
This tool will allow users to upload any picture and instantly transform it into a digital jigsaw puzzle. Users can then interactively drag and drop the pieces on the screen to reassemble the original image, providing a personalized and engaging puzzle-solving experience directly in their browser.

Data Plan / Schema
The core of this tool relies heavily on image data and puzzle configuration. Here's a breakdown of the data elements:

Original Image Data:

Type: Binary image data (e.g., PNG, JPEG).

Purpose: The source material for the puzzle.

Storage (Temporary): Will be loaded into an HTML Canvas for processing. Not persisted to a database in the basic version, but could be for future features (e.g., user galleries).

Puzzle Configuration:

rows (Integer): Number of horizontal cuts (e.g., 3, 4, 5).

columns (Integer): Number of vertical cuts (e.g., 3, 4, 5).

piece_width (Float): Calculated width of each puzzle piece based on image and column count.

piece_height (Float): Calculated height of each puzzle piece based on image and row count.

Purpose: Defines the complexity and structure of the puzzle.

Puzzle Piece Data (Array of Objects):

id (Integer): Unique identifier for each piece (e.g., 0, 1, 2...).

original_x (Integer): X-coordinate of the top-left corner of the piece in the original image.

original_y (Integer): Y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the piece in the original image.

current_x (Integer): X-coordinate of the top-left corner of the piece's current position on the canvas.

current_y (Integer): Y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the piece's current position on the canvas.

image_segment (Canvas ImageData/URL): The actual pixel data or a reference to the image segment for that piece.

Purpose: Represents the individual movable parts of the puzzle, tracking their correct and current positions.

User Interaction Data (Collected/Responded To):

is_dragging (Boolean): Flag indicating if a piece is currently being dragged.

selected_piece_id (Integer): ID of the piece currently being manipulated.

Purpose: Drives the drag-and-drop functionality and visual updates.

Open Question
My main open question right now is regarding the optimal method for handling the "snapping" or "correct placement" logic for puzzle pieces. Should it be based purely on proximity to the correct grid coordinates, or should there be a visual "snap" effect when pieces are close to their correct neighbors, even if not perfectly aligned to the final grid position? This impacts the user experience and the complexity of the drag-and-drop implementation.
