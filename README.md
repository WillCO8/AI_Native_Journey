# My AI-Native Journey

## üåü Welcome to My AI-Native Development Repository!

This repository is my personal space to document and share my progress as I learn and build in the exciting world of AI-Native development. Think of it as my public notebook!

Here, I plan to include:

* **Code Snippets:** Small pieces of code I write to understand concepts.
* **Mini-Projects:** Simple applications built using AI tools.
* **Learning Notes:** Summaries of new AI ideas, algorithms, or technologies I explore.
* **Tool Setup Guides:** How I get different AI tools and environments working.

My goal is to learn how to create smart, AI-powered applications from the ground up!

## üöÄ Getting Started with This Repository

If you're looking at my code or notes, here's how you can get a copy of this repository on your own computer:

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/willco8/AI_Native_Journey.git](https://github.com/willco8/AI_Native_Journey.git)
    ```
    (Remember to replace `willco8` with your actual GitHub username, if it's different in the future!)
2.  **Navigate into the Folder:**
    ```bash
    cd AI_Native_Journey
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies (If Any):** As I add projects, I'll list any necessary software or libraries here. For now, this might be empty.
    ```bash
    # Example: pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üìÅ What You'll Find Inside (My Progress)

This section will grow as I do! Each bullet point will link to a specific part of my journey.

* **Foundations of AI:** My notes and simple examples on core AI concepts.
    * [Link to a specific notes file, e.g., `notes/AI_Basics.md`]
* **First AI Model Experiment:** My initial attempt at building a small AI model.
    * [Link to a project folder, e.g., `projects/SimpleClassifier/README.md`]
* **Integrating with Gemini API:** How I'm using the Google Gemini API in my projects.
    * [Link to specific code examples or notes]

## üõ†Ô∏è My Current Toolkit

These are the main technologies and tools I'm focusing on in my learning:

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **AI Frameworks/Libraries:** Google Gemini API, [mention others as you learn, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, LangChain]
* **Code Editor:** Cursor IDE
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## üå± My Next Steps / Goals

* Understand the basics of Large Language Models (LLMs).
* Build a simple command-line chatbot.
* Learn how to use AI for image generation.
* [Add your own specific learning goals here!]
